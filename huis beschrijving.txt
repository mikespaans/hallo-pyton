I live in a terraced house. It has 1 bathroom, 1 living room, 1 kitchen, 2 toilets and 5 bedrooms.
 My favorite spot in the house is my own room beceause I do have a playstation 4 so I can game.
 My house does not have a balcony but its does have a garden and a front yard.
 In my living room there stands a couch against a wall with right next to it a window,
 on the opposite site of the couch there stands a tv.
 between the tv and the couch there stands a small table.
 on the other side of the living room we have a large eating table,
 with a window right next to it. Behind the eating table stands a small closet.
